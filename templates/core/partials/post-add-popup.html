				Our goal is to make Wikivinci a <b>very high
				quality</b> database of learning materials. That'll
				only happen with your help. Take a minute and review the
				following guidelines before submitting.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Avoid submitting news. Your submission should
					be useful for a long period of time.
				</li>

				<li>
					Avoid submitting products. Submitting books, courses, etc. that 
					need to be purchased is encouraged, but submitting "Adobe Photoshop"
					is not. 
				</li>

				<li>
					Any format (videos, slides, blog post, etc.) is fine, just
					make sure the learning value is explicit within the material.
				</li>

		Wikivinci was created to help people learn faster, and to promote continued learning.
		<br />
		<br />
		Often times, self-learning is harder than it needs to me. There are dozens of tutorials and
		resources online for anything you want to learn, but how do you decide which one to learn from?
		<br />
		<br />
		It's easy to waste your time evaluating tutorials. Is it too out-dated to learn from? Is the author
		credible? Has anyone else learned from this tutorial, and what did they think? These are some of
		the questions you might ask yourself as you're evaluating a learning material.
		<br />
		<br />
		Wikivinci was created because of this. Community members, like you, can submit high quality tutorials and resources, for any topic. Other members in the community have the ability to upvote, downvote, and comment on everything that's submitted to the platform.
		<br />
		<br />
		Over time, hopefully this community curation will make it easy to find the top X tutorials or resources for any topic. Easily, and without wasting time.
		<br />
		<br />
		In the mean time, you can sign up for an account to receive a digest of high quality tutorials
		and resources on any topic(s) you want to learn more about. This is a great way to keep learning,
		and to keep track of what's being added to Wikivinci!

<!-- 		<p>Self-learning is hard. For anything you need/want to learn, there are hundreds of resources and tutorials online, all with their own flavor. As a learner, you need to evaluate all of these resources before deciding which one to utilize.
		<br />
		<br />
		How old is the resource? Is it still relevant? Did other people use it? Is the author available for questions? -- these are just a few of the questions you might ask yourself as you try to find a good resource to learn from.
		<br />
		<br />
		<b>Wikivinci was created to help fix this.</b> Community members, like you, can post good resources and tutorials to Wikivinci. Other community members have the ability to upvote, downvote, and add comments to every 
		resource on Wikivinci, including the ones you add. The goal is for the community to curate these resources and tutorials over time, so that it's easier for people to find the best resources for learning.
